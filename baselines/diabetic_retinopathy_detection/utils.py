  It starts with a linear warmup to the initial learning rate over
  `warmup_epochs`. This is found to be helpful for large batch size training
  (Goyal et al., 2018). The learning rate's value then uses the initial
  learning rate, and decays by a multiplier at the start of each epoch in
  `decay_epochs`. The stepwise decaying schedule follows He et al. (2015).

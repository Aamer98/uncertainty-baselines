# Out-of-Distribution Detection and Selective Generation for Conditional Language Models

This repository contains code to compute the relative Mahalanobis distance (RMD) used in
[Out-of-Distribution Detection and Selective Generation for Conditional Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15558) for out-of-distributino detection for conditional language models. 
The RMD score is shown to be a highly accurate and lightweight OOD detection method for CLMs, as demonstrated on abstractive summarization and translation.
